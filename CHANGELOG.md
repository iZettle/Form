## 1.10.0
- `TableKit` and `CollectionKit` do no longer require the passing of a bag to their initializers. This means that the life-time of a kit instance is no longer kept alive by a provided bag. For most usages that should not change the behaviour but if the kit is prematurely deallocted you can always explicity hold on to it `bag.hold(kit)`.
- `TableKit`'s and `CollectionKit`'s initializers taking a bag parameter have been deprecated. Instead use the new initializers introduced above.

## 1.3.1

- Updates NumberEditor to handle entering and editing of negative value
- Disables autocorrection for ValueField by defualt

## 1.0.2

- Fixes a bug with `install` view(s) into scroll views where the content fits but the scroll view still won't scroll even though `InstallOptions.disableScrollingIfContentFits`` was not provided.
